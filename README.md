# Philly-Eats

"Philly Eats", invites you to explore delicious dining options in Philadelphia! This website welcomes you to try new cuisines and test your luck by going completely random, hope you enjoy it!

## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from Philly's rich blend of history and food culture. Philadelphia, known for its iconic cheesesteaks, soft pretzels, and diverse culinary scene, offers a wide range of flavors from around the world. The cityâ€™s neighborhoods each bring their unique cultural influences, creating a vibrant, ever-evolving food scene. By showcasing random restaurants, this app celebrates that mix, helping people discover hidden gems while embracing Philly's rich culinary heritage!

## What it does

The "Philly Eats" app helps users find random restaurants in Philadelphia based on their chosen cuisine and budget. It reveals a surprise restaurant location on a map, providing details like the name, address, and food style. With its fun design and randomization feature, it offers an exciting way to explore the city's diverse food scene.

## How we built it

The "Philly Eats" app was built using Streamlit, a framework for creating interactive web apps in Python. Folium was used to integrate interactive maps, allowing users to visualize restaurant locations dynamically. Pandas helped handle and manipulate the data, such as restaurant details like cuisine type, cost, and addresses. The streamlit_folium library enabled seamless embedding of the Folium maps into the Streamlit app. Lastly, custom HTML and CSS styling were used for UI elements like buttons, GIFs, and sidebar instructions to enhance the user experience with a playful design.

## Challenges we ran into

Initially, there were mapping issues that led to the app not displaying restaurant locations properly. Additionally, we experienced several design trials and errors while trying to create a visually appealing layout. Finding the right balance between user-friendliness and aesthetics took some time and experimentation. These challenges ultimately helped us improve our problem-solving skills and better understand the tools we were using.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

After several design iterations, we created an intuitive interface that balances aesthetics and functionality, ensuring a pleasant user experience. Through this project, we gained valuable experience with Streamlit, Folium, and data manipulation using Pandas, enhancing our overall programming skills

## What we learned

The project taught us the importance of user feedback in design. We focused on creating a seamless experience that balances aesthetics and functionality, ensuring that users can easily navigate and find the information they need.

## What's next for Philly Eats

 We aim to incorporate additional features such as user reviews, ratings, and the ability for users to submit their favorite restaurants. This will create a community aspect and help users discover hidden gems.
